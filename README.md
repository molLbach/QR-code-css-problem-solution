I had some issues centering the div, tried using flexboxs, didn't know how so I just used absolute positioning, I will need to check flexboxs again in the future.
everything else wasn't too hard, just trying to resize the qr image and play with the margin/border and width to make things look like the given design.
overall not a very complicated problem but non the less a fun one!.
